# Is Biochar a Carbon Capture solution?

Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is a critical and global challenge that demands immediate action to mitigate the worst effects of climate change. Among available carbon removal solutions, biochar stands out as a mature and ready-to-deploy technology already accounting for over 90% of delivered carbon removal credits. By transforming organic waste into a stable, long-term carbon sink, biochar provides an immediate and scalable solution to remove atmospheric carbon while delivering significant co-benefits.
