# What is Biochar?

Biochar is a black, porous, and carbon-rich material created by heating organic biomass in a low-oxygen environment–a process called pyrolysis. The biomass can include wood, agricultural residues, and food waste. While it may look like charcoal, it’s actually a powerful tool that captures carbon, regenerates soil, and improves climate resilience.
