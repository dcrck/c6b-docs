# Properties of Biochar

## High surface area

As volatile gasses escape during pyrolysis, they carve microscopic channels in the material. This gives biochar unusually high porosity and surface area. 

## Stable structure

The carbon meanwhile forms into stable polycyclic rings that resist normal microbial decomposition. In this structure, carbon stays locked in for hundreds or thousands of years. 

These qualities enable biochar to act as a sponge for water and nutrients, making it an ideal soil enhancement that also sequesters carbon.
