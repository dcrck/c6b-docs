# How long does biochar sequester carbon?

Once carbon is locked into biochar through pyrolysis, it remains in that form and becomes resistant to regular decomposition. Both established and evolving verification methods like hydrogen-to-carbon ratios and inertinite content demonstrate permanence often exceeding thousands of years. This durability puts quality biochar on par with geological storage solutions such as weathering and direct air capture.
