# How is biochar used in materials production?

While it has potent agricultural applications, biochar can also contribute to carbon-negative materials production and the built environment. It can be mixed into cement, asphalt, or bricks to durably store carbon in buildings and offset construction-related emissions. It can also be used as a replacement for fossil fuel sources of carbon in processes like steelmaking.
