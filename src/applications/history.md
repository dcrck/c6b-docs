# The History of Biochar

Biochar has been used in traditional agriculture for over 2,500 years. Terra preta (or black earth) improved and protected soil fertility in the Amazon rainforest for hundreds of years and have left lasting benefits to this day. Modern efforts are to efficiently scale this technology to meet today’s climate and agricultural needs.
