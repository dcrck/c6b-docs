# All about Pyrolysis

While similar to combustion, pyrolysis is different. Since the high temperature is applied in a zero-oxygen environment, there's no fire.

Pyrolysis subjects biomass to thermal decomposition between 400°C and 800°C during which combustible and volatile gasses escape and leave stable carbon behind. These gasses condense into pyrolysis’s primary byproducts: syngas and bio-oil. These can be reused and combusted to sustain the pyrolysis process. The temperature, heating rate, and residence time can be tailored to favor any of these three products.
