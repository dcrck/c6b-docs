# What is the circular economy, and how does biochar fit into it?

The **circular economy** is a sustainable model focused on reducing waste and reusing resources as long as possible. In this context, biochar transforms organic “waste” into high-value products that sequester carbon and support climate-smart agriculture. It contributes to a closed-loop system where "waste" is another valuable resource, costs are lowered, and environmental impacts are improved.
