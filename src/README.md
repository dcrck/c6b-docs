# Overview

## Introduction to Biochar

### What is Biochar?

Biochar is a black, porous, and carbon-rich material created by heating organic biomass in a low-oxygen environment–a process called pyrolysis. The biomass can include wood, agricultural residues, and food waste. While it may look like charcoal, it’s actually a powerful tool that captures carbon, regenerates soil, and improves climate resilience.

### All about Pyrolysis

While similar to combustion, pyrolysis is different. Since the high temperature is applied in a zero-oxygen environment, there's no fire.

Pyrolysis subjects biomass to thermal decomposition between 400°C and 800°C during which combustible and volatile gasses escape and leave stable carbon behind. These gasses condense into pyrolysis’s primary byproducts: syngas and bio-oil. These can be reused and combusted to sustain the pyrolysis process. The temperature, heating rate, and residence time can be tailored to favor any of these three products.

### Properties of Biochar

#### High surface area

As volatile gasses escape during pyrolysis, they carve microscopic channels in the material. This gives biochar unusually high porosity and surface area. 

#### Stable structure

The carbon meanwhile forms into stable polycyclic rings that resist normal microbial decomposition. In this structure, carbon stays locked in for hundreds or thousands of years. 

These qualities enable biochar to act as a sponge for water and nutrients, making it an ideal soil enhancement that also sequesters carbon.

### Biochar in the Circular Economy

The **circular economy** is a sustainable model focused on reducing waste and reusing resources as long as possible. In this context, biochar transforms organic “waste” into high-value products that sequester carbon and support climate-smart agriculture. It contributes to a closed-loop system where "waste" is another valuable resource, costs are lowered, and environmental impacts are improved.

## Applications of Biochar

### Biochar throughout History

Biochar has been used in traditional agriculture for over 2,500 years. Terra preta (or black earth) improved and protected soil fertility in the Amazon rainforest for hundreds of years and have left lasting benefits to this day. Modern efforts are to efficiently scale this technology to meet today’s climate and agricultural needs.

### Biochar in Agriculture

When incorporated into soil, biochar improves harvests and saves resources. Extensive research shows that biochar application increases plant productivity by 16% and crop yield by 13%. It improves available water content by 15% and water use efficiency by 20%. Biochar also boosts soil organic carbon matter by 40%, delivering a wide range of benefits to agricultural producers

### Biochar in Materials Production

While it has potent agricultural applications, biochar can also contribute to carbon-negative materials production and the built environment. It can be mixed into cement, asphalt, or bricks to durably store carbon in buildings and offset construction-related emissions. It can also be used as a replacement for fossil fuel sources of carbon in processes like steelmaking.

### Other Uses for Biochar

Biochar has a highly porous structure, which makes it an excellent filter for both air and water. It can soak up toxic contaminants, GHG emissions, chemicals, and heavy metals alike. Other applications are emerging in medicine, cosmetics, electronics, and even energy storage. The possibilities are vast and expanding.

## Carbon Capture with Biochar

### Biochar as a Carbon Capture Solution

Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is a critical and global challenge that demands immediate action to mitigate the worst effects of climate change. Among available carbon removal solutions, biochar stands out as a mature and ready-to-deploy technology already accounting for over 90% of delivered carbon removal credits. By transforming organic waste into a stable, long-term carbon sink, biochar provides an immediate and scalable solution to remove atmospheric carbon while delivering significant co-benefits.

### Ensuring Biochar's Permanence

Once carbon is locked into biochar through pyrolysis, it remains in that form and becomes resistant to regular decomposition. Both established and evolving verification methods like hydrogen-to-carbon ratios and inertinite content demonstrate permanence often exceeding thousands of years. This durability puts quality biochar on par with geological storage solutions such as weathering and direct air capture.

### Advantages of Biochar Credits

Biochar stands out as a powerful carbon removal solution that transforms waste into a long-term carbon sink with valuable environmental and agricultural co-benefits. It’s a mature and ready-to-deploy technology with lower costs compared to many emerging solutions. Carbon credit sales further enhance biochar’s accessibility by reducing direct costs to farmers and increasing the rate at which adoption can scale.
